# 🎯 Letter Flash

Letter Flash is a fun, interactive browser game designed to help kids (or anyone) practice letter recognition and typing skills.  
It flashes a random letter on screen, speaks it aloud, and gives instant feedback — with animations, sound effects, and a streak counter to keep things engaging.
